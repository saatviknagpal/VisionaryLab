# Layout Component Documentation

[TOC]

## 1. Overview

The `Layout` component is a simple React functional component designed to provide a basic layout structure for authenticated sections of the application.  It wraps its child components within a `<main>` element with the class name `auth`. This allows for consistent styling and structure across authenticated pages.


## 2. Component Structure

The `Layout` component is a functional component defined using the arrow function syntax.

| Element     | Description                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Layout`    | The main functional component.                    |
| `{children}` | A prop accepting ReactNode.  This represents the content to be rendered within the layout. |
| `<main>`    | The HTML element used to structure the layout.     |
| `className='auth'` |  A class name applied to the `<main>` element for styling purposes. |


## 3. Props

The `Layout` component accepts a single prop:

| Prop Name    | Type             | Description                                     | Required | Default |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|
| `children`  | `React.ReactNode` | The content to be rendered within the layout. | Yes      | N/A     |


## 4. Function Details

The `Layout` component is straightforward. It receives its children through props and renders them within a `<main>` element.  There's no complex logic or algorithms involved.  The function simply acts as a container for content, applying the "auth" class for styling. The `React.ReactNode` type for `children` allows for flexibility, accepting any valid React children (e.g., components, text, numbers).


## 5. Example Usage

```jsx
<Layout>
  <h1>Welcome to the Dashboard</h1>
  <p>This is your authenticated content.</p>
</Layout>
```

This would render:

```html
<main class="auth">
  <h1>Welcome to the Dashboard</h1>
  <p>This is your authenticated content.</p>
</main>
```
