## 1. Overview

This document details the implementation of the `/pages/image/[id].tsx` page, responsible for displaying and allowing updates to a specific image's transformation settings.  The page uses Clerk.js for authentication and fetches data from the backend via custom actions.

## 2. Page Component (`Page`)

The `Page` component is an asynchronous function that renders a page allowing users to update image transformations.

### 2.1. Authentication and Authorization

The component first retrieves the user ID using `auth()`, provided by the `@clerk/nextjs` library.  If no user is authenticated (`!userId`), the user is redirected to the `/sign-in` page using `next/navigation.redirect()`. This ensures only authenticated users can access and modify image data.

### 2.2. Data Fetching

After authentication, the component fetches data from the backend:

1. **User Data:**  The `getUserById(userId)` function retrieves the user's information, including their `_id` and `creditBalance`, using the authenticated user's ID.  This function's implementation is not detailed here but assumed to retrieve user data from a database.

2. **Image Data:** The `getImage(id)` function retrieves the image data based on the `id` parameter passed to the page.  This function is assumed to retrieve image data, including `transformationType` and `config`, from a database. The `id` parameter is extracted from the URL using the `params` prop, typical of Next.js's dynamic routing.

The fetched `transformationType` is used to retrieve the corresponding transformation details from the `transformationTypes` constant, providing the title and subtitle for the header.

### 2.3. UI Rendering

The component renders the following elements:

1. **Header:** A `<Header>` component is rendered, displaying the transformation title and subtitle obtained from the `transformationTypes` lookup.

2. **Transformation Form:** A `<TransformationForm>` component is rendered, providing the interface for updating the image transformation.  The component receives the following props:
    * `action`: "Update" - indicating the form's purpose.
    * `userId`: The ID of the authenticated user.
    * `type`: The type of image transformation.
    * `creditBalance`: The user's remaining credit balance.
    * `config`: The current configuration of the image transformation.
    * `data`: The complete image data object.

The form's handling of user input and update logic is not detailed within this document.  It's assumed to handle form submission and backend communication.



## 3. Function Details

This section provides details on functions used in the component:

| Function Name          | Description                                                                         | Algorithm                                                                                     | Dependencies                                   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `getUserById(userId)` | Retrieves user data from the database based on the provided `userId`.               |  Database query (implementation not shown).                                                    | Database connection, potentially ORM/ODM.      |
| `getImage(id)`        | Retrieves image data from the database based on the provided `id`.                 | Database query (implementation not shown).                                                    | Database connection, potentially ORM/ODM.      |


Note:  The algorithms for `getUserById` and `getImage` are not detailed as their implementations are external to this component and assumed to be well-documented elsewhere.  The focus here is on the component's integration and usage of these functions.
