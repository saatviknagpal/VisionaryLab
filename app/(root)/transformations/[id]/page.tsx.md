## 1. Overview

The `ImageDetails` component displays details and allows for the update or deletion of a specific image. It fetches image data based on an ID passed through the URL parameters, renders the original and transformed versions of the image, and shows relevant metadata such as prompt, color, aspect ratio, and transformation type.  Conditional rendering is used to display update/delete options only to the image's author.


## 2. Imports

The component uses the following imports:

| Import Statement             | Description                                                                     |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{ auth } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";` |  Imports authentication functions from Clerk.js.                             |
| `Image from "next/image";`     | Imports the Next.js Image component for image rendering.                       |
| `Link from "next/link";`       | Imports the Next.js Link component for navigation.                             |
| `Header from "@/components/shared/Header";` | Imports a custom Header component.                                           |
| `TransformedImage from "@/components/shared/TransformedImage";` | Imports a custom component to display the transformed image.                 |
| `{ Button } from "@/components/ui/button";` | Imports a custom Button component.                                             |
| `{ getImage } from "@/lib/actions/image.actions";` | Imports a function to fetch image data.                                      |
| `{ getImageSize } from "@/lib/utils";` | Imports a utility function to determine image dimensions.                      |
| `DeleteConfirmation from "@/components/shared/DeleteConfirmation";` | Imports a custom component for delete confirmation.                       |


## 3. `ImageDetails` Component

### 3.1. Function Parameters

The `ImageDetails` component is a functional component that accepts a single parameter:

| Parameter      | Type             | Description                                              |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `{ params: { id } }` | `SearchParamsProps` | An object containing URL parameters, specifically the image ID (`id`). |


### 3.2. Authentication and Data Fetching

The component first uses `auth()` from `@clerk/nextjs/server` to retrieve the currently authenticated user's ID (`userId`).  It then calls `getImage(id)` to fetch the image data from the backend, using the `id` provided in the URL parameters.  This is an asynchronous operation, reflected by the use of `await`.


### 3.3. UI Rendering

The component renders the following elements:

* A header displaying the image's title using the `Header` component.
* A section displaying image metadata (transformation type, prompt, color, and aspect ratio).  These details are conditionally rendered based on their presence in the `image` object.
* A section showing both the original and transformed images using the `Image` and `TransformedImage` components respectively.  The dimensions of the original image are calculated using the `getImageSize` utility function.
* If the authenticated user's ID (`userId`) matches the image author's ID (`image.author.clerkId`),  "Update Image" and "Delete" buttons are rendered, allowing the author to modify or delete the image.


### 3.4. Image Size Calculation (`getImageSize`)

The `getImageSize` function (imported from `@/lib/utils`) is crucial for correctly displaying the original image. While the implementation details of `getImageSize` are not provided in this code snippet, it likely takes the image transformation type, the image object itself, and the desired dimension ("width" or "height") as input and returns the appropriate pixel value.  This function likely handles different transformation types and ensures the correct size is used for rendering,  preventing distortion or incorrect aspect ratios.


## 4. Component Structure

The component's structure is organized into sections using `<section>` elements for better semantic meaning and maintainability.  Conditional rendering is used extensively to display metadata and actions based on the image data and user authentication status.  The use of Tailwind CSS classes facilitates styling.
