# Layout Component Documentation

[TOC]

## 1. Overview

The `Layout` component serves as a master template for the application's pages. It provides a consistent structure by incorporating shared components such as a sidebar, mobile navigation, and a toaster for notifications.  This ensures a unified user experience across all application views.

## 2. Component Structure

The `Layout` component is a functional component using React's functional component syntax. It accepts a single prop:

| Prop Name  | Type                 | Description                                      |
|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `children` | `React.ReactNode`    | The content to be rendered within the main layout. |


## 3. Code Implementation

```javascript
import MobileNav from '@/components/shared/MobileNav'
import Sidebar from '@/components/shared/Sidebar'
import { Toaster } from '@/components/ui/toaster'
import React from 'react'

const Layout = ({children}: {children:React.ReactNode}) => {
  return (
    <main className='root'>
      <Sidebar/>
      <MobileNav />
      <div className='root-container'>
          <div className='wrapper'>{children}</div>
      </div>
      <Toaster />
    </main>
  )
}

export default Layout
```

The component renders the following elements within a `<main>` element with the class `root`:

1.  **`<Sidebar />`**: Renders the sidebar navigation component.
2.  **`<MobileNav />`**: Renders the mobile navigation component.
3.  **`<div className='root-container'>`**: A container to hold the main content.  This provides a way to visually separate and style the main content area.
    * **`<div className='wrapper'>{children}</div>`**:  This div, with the class `wrapper`, holds the dynamically injected `children` prop, representing the page-specific content.  This allows for easy styling and placement of the main content area.
4.  **`<Toaster />`**: Renders a toaster component for displaying notifications to the user.

The structure is designed to be simple and flexible, allowing for easy extension and customization.  No complex algorithms or computations are involved in this component.  Its primary function is to compose existing components into a coherent layout.

## 4. Usage Example

The `Layout` component is used by wrapping other components, injecting their JSX as children:

```javascript
<Layout>
  <h1>My Page Title</h1>
  <p>This is the content of my page.</p>
</Layout>
```

This will render the page title and paragraph within the `wrapper` div defined in the `Layout` component.

## 5. Styling

The component uses CSS classes (`root`, `root-container`, `wrapper`) for styling.  These classes are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the stylesheets.  The specific styling details are outside the scope of this documentation.
